# Programming in R: a brief introduction
### Alex Pacheco and Jeremy Mack
### February 28, 2020

---

### About this presentation

 * This course is a **brief introduction** into R.
 
 * It is targeted at people that have little to no experience
   progamming.
   
 * It could be useful for people who learned R some time ago and
   forgot it, or who are not familiar with modern R programming
   (`tidyverse`).
   
 * It focuses on a bit of history, an introduction to the R 
   environment, and some hands experience with **data wrangling**.
   
---

### Structure of the presentation

The presentation is split into five topics:

 * **Topic 1:** What is R? Why use it?
 
 * **Topic 2:** What is RStudio? Why use it?
 
 * **Topic 3:** Getting started with R and RStudio
 
 * **Topic 4:** Programming in R
 
 * **Topic 5:** Data and data wrangling
 
 * **Topic 6:** Plotting

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

* How do I get R, or RStudio?

 + You can download R on its own through the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org).
   
 + You can download RStudio, including R,
   at the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
   
---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
   
* R and RStudio at Lehigh

 + Both R and RStudio are available on [LUapps](https://luapps.lehigh.edu), a virtualized software system that allows users to use software programs, without having to download them to their machine.
 
 + LUapps can be accessed both on campus and off-campus (over VPN).

&lt;img src="./images/luapps.png" align="center" alt="LUApps website"/&gt;

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

First, lets explore RStudio.

[&lt;img src="./images/rstudio.png" align="center" alt="RStudio" height=500/&gt;](https://luapps.lehigh.edu)

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

First, let's explore RStudio.

&lt;img src="./images/rstudio2.png" align="center" alt="RStudio" height=500/&gt;

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Next, let's explore R - the engine under the hood.

In true computer science fashion, let's first try typing:


```r
print("Hello world!")
```

What happend?

--


```
[1] "Hello world!"
```

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Two things to note:

- We didn't just get "Hello world!", we also got `[1]`. This is R's way
of printing to the screen; it's telling us the position we're at.

- We didn't need to put anything at the end of the line, we just hit return.

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Now, let's try three things...

Try capitalizing `Print(...)`:
 

```r
Print("Hello world!")
```

Try putting a space between `print` and `("Hello world!")`:


```r
print ("Hello world!")
```

Try just entering `"Hello world!"`:


```r
"Hello world!"
```

What happened?

--
 

```
Error in Print("Hello world!"): could not find function "Print"
```


```
[1] "Hello world!"
```


```
[1] "Hello world!"
```

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Three things you just learned:

 - R is **case-sensitive**.
 
 - R does not care about **whitespace**.
 
 - R will **print** results by default.

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

You can also use R as a calculator. Let's try the following:


```r
2 + 2
```
--

```
[1] 4
```
--

```r
4 * 2
```
--

```
[1] 8
```
--

```r
8 / 3
```
--

```
[1] 2.666667
```
--

```r
exp(log(8)-log(3))
```
--

```
[1] 2.666667
```

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Assignments

We often want to save the results of our calculations, rather than print them to the screen. To do so, 
we'll use the **assignment operator**, `&lt;-`

Here's an example:


```r
x &lt;- log(8)
y &lt;- log(3)
```
--
Now we can redo our last calculation using the assignments:


```r
exp(x-y)
```

```
[1] 2.666667
```

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Concatenation

We will often want to work on sequences of values, rather than specific values. 

To do so, we'll use the **concatenation operator**, `c(...)`

Here's an example:


```r
n &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
```

--

We can now apply opertions across the entire vector.

For example:


```r
n * 2
```

```
[1]   4   6  10  16  26  42  68 110
```

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Logicals

It can be useful to know whether our values meet certain conditions. 

In addition to **character values** (which we saw when we called `print("Hello world!")`), R also allows **logical values**, or `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

For example, we can check which numbers in our "n" vector are double digit:


```r
n
```

```
[1]  2  3  5  8 13 21 34 55
```

```r
is_double_digit &lt;- n &gt; 9
is_double_digit
```

```
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

class: inverse

#### Review - Getting started with R and RStudio:
* RStudio has four main windows to keep things organized.

* R is **case-sensitive**.

* R is a calculator.

* R can be used to store objects that can be compared to other objects, or used with other functions.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

---

#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

R revolves around two things: **objects** and **functions**. Almost everything in R is either an object or a function.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define objects &gt; Apply functions &gt; Repeat!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

--

For example, we can define a simple object called "n":


```r
n &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
```

--

We can then apply a function to our object. Lets say we're interested in the average, so we'll apply the mean function:


```r
mean(n)
```

```
[1] 17.625
```

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R:
* Objects come in many different shapes and sizes - like a number, a dataset, a summary statistic, or the results of a statistical test.

--

* Objects have different **attributes** - properties that explain what an object represents and how it should be interpreted.

--

* Objects are essentially *data* that have a particular **type** and **structure**.

--

* There are five basic types in R:
 1. Numeric
 2. Integer
 3. Complex
 4. Logical
 5. Character
 
---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Numeric - a number; default data type in R
 

```r
x &lt;- 10.5               # Define object x

```

```
[1] "numeric"
```

---

```

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Complex - any number that can be written as a + bi, where *i* is the imaginary unit and a and b
are real numbers.


```r
x &lt;- 1 + 2i             # create a complex number x
x                       # print the value of x 
```

```
[1] 1+2i

```

```
[1] "complex"
```

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Logical - created via comparison(s) between variables.


```r
x &lt;- 1; y &lt;- 2          # create sample values x and y
z &lt;- x &gt; y              # is x larger than y? 
z                       # print the logical value 
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

```r
class(z)                # Print the class name of z
```

```
[1] "logical"
```

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Character - used to represent string values in R.


```r
x &lt;- as.character(3.14) # Convert to character
x                       # print the character string 
```

```
[1] "3.14"
```

```r
class(x)                # Print the class name of x
```

```
[1] "character"
```
--

```r
x &lt;- "3.14"             # Can declare as character with " "
x                       # Print x
```

```
[1] "3.14"
```

```r
class(x)                # Print the class name of x

#### Review - Objects:
* Define objects &gt; Apply functions &gt; Repeat!

* Objects are defined by data, which there are five main types.

* Objects come in different sizes and shapes, from a single, scalar, object, to a data frame that contains multiple vectors of different data types.

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

R revolves around two things: **objects** and **functions**. Almost everything in R is either an object or a function.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define objects &gt; Apply functions &gt; Repeat!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Functions in R:

* Functions are procedures that typically take one or more objects as **arguments** (i.e., inputs), does something with them, then returns a new object (i.e., result).

--

* Functions vary in complexity - like computing a mean, to a statistical test.

--

* How do we get functions loaded into R?
 1. Write your own.

 2. Community development (**Packages**)!

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Packages in R:

* R packages are collections of functions developed by the [R community](&lt;https://cran.case.edu&gt;).

--

* Packages also include data sets, help documentation, and how-to examples (i.e., vignette).

--

* When you download and install R for the first time, you are installing the **base R** - only functions written by the original authors of the R language.

--

* How de we get ~~functions~~ packages loaded into R?

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Packages in R:

* How de we get packages loaded into R?

 + Programmatically

```r

#### Review - Functions and Packages:
* Define objects &gt; Apply functions &gt; Repeat!

* Functions are used to work with objects in R and are loaded via packages.

* Standard functions are a part of base R, a series of packages that load automatically when R is opened.

* There is a large community of users that develop packages for R.

* Packages can be loaded with install.packages(...), or in the Explorer window in RStudio.

Visualizing data in R

 * Let's try the first function by itself. What happened?

```r
 ggplot(data=df)
```

 * Now lets add some layers, with the second function.

```r
 ggplot(data=df) +
 geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
```

 * Now lets add an additional **aesthetic**.

```r
 ggplot(data=df) +
 geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))
```

 * We can also add additional layers [geoms](&lt;https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf&gt;).

```r
 ggplot(data=df) +
 geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class)) +
 geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy), method="lm")

        axis.title=element_text(size = 7),
        legend.text=element_text(size = 7),
        legend.title=element_text(size = 7),
        legend.key=element_blank(),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=.5, size=8)) +
    geom_point(aes(color=class),size=0.25) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", size=0.25) +
    labs(title="Highway mileage by engine displacement",

class: inverse

#### Review - Plotting:
* Data can look quantitatively the same, but qualitatively different.

* **ggplot2** package in R uses a multi-function approach to plotting.

* More on visualizing data in a few weeks...
