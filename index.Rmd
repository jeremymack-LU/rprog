### About this presentation

 * This course is a **brief introduction** into R.

--
 
 * It is targeted at people that have little to no experience
   progamming.

--
   
 * It could be useful for people who learned R some time ago and
   forgot it, or who are not familiar with modern R programming
   (`tidyverse`).

--

 * It focuses on a bit of history, an introduction to the R 
   environment, and some hands experience with **data wrangling**.

--

* Slides are available on [Lehigh's Research Computing site](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/display/hpc/Seminars) and Github ([slides](https://jeremymack-lu.github.io/rprog/) and [raw code](https://github.com/jeremymack-LU/rprog))

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

First, let's explore RStudio.

[<img src="./images/rstudio.png" align="center" alt="RStudio" height=500/>](https://luapps.lehigh.edu)

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

First, let's explore RStudio.

  pre {
    background-color: lightyellow;
    white-space: pre-wrap;
    line-height: 100%;
  }
</style>

Next, let's explore R - the engine under the hood.

In true computer science fashion, let's first try typing:

.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
print("Hello world!")
```
]

What happend?

--

.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
print("Hello world!")
```
]

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Two things to note:

- We didn't just get "Hello world!", we also got `[1]`. This is R's way
of printing to the screen; it's telling us the position we're at.

- We didn't need to put anything at the end of the line, we just hit return.

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Now, let's try three things...

Try capitalizing `Print(...)`:
 
.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
Print("Hello world!")
```
]

Try putting a space between `print` and `("Hello world!")`:

.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
print ("Hello world!")
```
]

Try just entering `"Hello world!"`:

.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
"Hello world!"
```
]

What happened?

--
 
.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, error=TRUE, comment=NA}
Print("Hello world!")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
print ("Hello world!")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
"Hello world!"
```
]

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

Three things you just learned:

 - R is **case-sensitive**.
 
 - R does not care about **whitespace**.
 
 - R will **print** results by default.

---

#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio

You can also use R as a calculator. Let's try the following:

.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
2 + 2
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
4 * 2
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
4 * 2
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
8 / 3
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
8 / 3
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r eval=FALSE}
exp(log(8)-log(3))
```
]
--
.tiny[
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
exp(log(8)-log(3))
```
]

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Assignments

We often want to save the results of our calculations, rather than print them to the screen. To do so, 
we'll use the **assignment operator**, `<-`

Here's an example:

.tiny[
```{r}
x <- log(8)
y <- log(3)
```
]

--
Now we can redo our last calculation using the assignments:

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
exp(x-y)
```
]

 *Shortcut in RStudio: Option + - (Mac OS), Alt + - (Windows OS)

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Concatenation

We will often want to work on sequences of values, rather than specific values. 

To do so, we'll use the **concatenation operator**, `c(...)`

Here's an example:

.tiny[
```{r}
n <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
```
]

--

We can now apply opertions across the entire vector.

For example:

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
n * 2
```
]

---
#### Topic 3: Getting started with R and RStudio
#### Logicals

It can be useful to know whether our values meet certain conditions. 

In addition to **character values** (which we saw when we called `print("Hello world!")`), R also allows **logical values**, or `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

For example, we can check which numbers in our "n" vector are double digit:

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
n
is_double_digit <- n > 9
is_double_digit
```
]

---
class: inverse

#### Review - Getting started with R and RStudio:
* RStudio has four main windows to keep things **organized**.

* R is **case-sensitive**.

* R is a calculator.

* R can be used to store objects (**assignments**) that can be used with other functions, or compared to other objects.

#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

R largely revolves around two things: **objects** and **functions**.

<center><b>Define objects > Apply functions > Repeat!</b></center>

--

For example, we can define a simple object called "n":

.tiny[
```{r}
n <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
```
]

--

We can then apply a function to our object. Lets say we're interested in the average, so we'll apply the mean function:

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
avg.n <- mean(n)
avg.n
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R:
* Objects come in many different shapes and sizes - like a number, a dataset, or the results of a statistical test.

--

* Objects are essentially *data* that have a particular **type** and **structure**.

--

* There are five basic **types** (classes) of data in R:
 1. Logical
 2. Double
 3. Integer
 4. Complex
 5. Character
 {{content}}
--
 6. Factors - special case of Integer with Character labels
 {{content}}
 
---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Logical - created via comparison(s).

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
x <- 1; y <- 2          # Create sample values x and y
z <- x > y              # Is x larger than y? 
z                       # Print the logical value 
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
typeof(z)               # Print the data type of z
```
]
 
---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Double - a number, often approximated; default data type in R
 
.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
x <- 10.5               # Define object x
x                       # Print x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Integer - whole numbers; a number that is not a fraction

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
x <- 10                 # Define object x
x                       # Print x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Integer - whole numbers; a number that is not a fraction

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
x <- as.integer(10)     # Declare as integer
x                       # Print x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
x <- 10L                # Declare as integer by appending with "L"
x                       # Print x
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Complex - any number that can be written as a + bi, where *i* is the imaginary unit and a and b
are real numbers.

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
x <- 1 + 2i             # Create a complex number x
x                       # Print the value of x 
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Character - used to represent string values in R.

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
x <- as.character(3.14) # Declare as character
x                       # Print the character string 
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r comment=NA}
x <- "3.14"             # Declare as character with " "
x                       # Print x
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Objects in R - data types:
* Factor - fixed set of possible values (categorical variables); stored as integers

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
x <- c("A","B","C","D") # Create a vector of factor levels
x <- as.factor(x)       # Declare as factor
x                       # Print the value of x 
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}
typeof(x)               # Print the data type of x
```
]

--

.tiny[
```{r, comment=NA}

#### Review - Objects:
* Define objects > Apply functions > Repeat!

* Objects are data that have a type and structure. 

* There are five basic types of data:
   1. Logical
   2. Double - default data type in R
   3. Integer
   4. Complex
   5. Character
   6. Factors - special case of Integer with Character labels

* There are four basic structures:
   1. Scalar
   2. Vector
   3. Matrix
   4. Data frames (and Tibbles)

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

R largely revolves around two things: **objects** and **functions**.

<center><b>Define objects > Apply functions > Repeat!</b></center>

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Functions in R:

* Functions are procedures that typically take one or more objects as **arguments** (i.e., inputs), does something with them, then returns a new object (i.e., result).

--

* Functions vary in complexity - like computing a mean, to a statistical test.

--

* How do we get functions loaded into R?

--

 1. Write your own.

.tiny6[
```{r, comment=NA}
ages <- c(99,46,23,54,23)
```
]
 .tiny6[
```{r, comment=NA}
age_mean <- function(x) {
  summation <- sum(x)
  summation / length(x)
}
age_mean(ages)
```
]

 1. Write your own.

 2. Community development (**Packages**)!

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

Packages in R:

* R packages are used to install pre-built functions into the R Environment.

--

* In addition to functions, packages also include data sets, help documentation, and how-to examples (i.e., vignette).

--

* When install R for the first time, you are installing the [base R](<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html>), which includes only functions written by the original authors of the R language.

--

* Additional packages are developed by the [R community](<https://cran.case.edu>).

--

* How de we get ~~functions~~ packages loaded into R?

---
#### Topic 4: Objects and Functions

How do we get packages loaded into R?

* Two step process:
 1. Install the package - do this once
 
 2. Load the package into R - do this every time

# More efficient way
install.packages("pacman")     # Install pacman package
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr) # Use p_load function
```

#### Review - Functions (and Packages):
* Define objects > Apply functions > Repeat!

* Functions are used to work with objects in R and are loaded via packages.

* Standard functions are a part of **base R**, which loads automatically when R is opened.

* There is also a **large community** of users that develop packages for R (18,300+ and counting!).

* Packages can be loaded both programmatically and with the RStudio explorer window.

* Two step process:
  1. Install package
  
  2. Load package into library

#### Review - Data and Data Wrangling:

 * Working directories can be set both programmatically and with the RStudio IDE.

 * Similarly, data can be read into R programmatically and with the RStudio IDE.

 * R identifies data by row (observation) then column (variable).

 * Pay attention to function arguments - missing values can cause problems!

```{r comment=NA, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
a <- filter(mpg, year==2008)
b <- group_by(a, cyl)
c <- summarize(b,
               Avg=mean(hwy))
d <- arrange(c, desc(Avg))
print(d)

#### Exercise - Summarizing Data:
 
 * The *mpg* dataset provides data on fuel efficiency for a variety of vehicles in 1999 and 2008.

--

 * Using that data and the piping method:
  1. What manufacturer had the highest highway mpg in 1999? Was it the same one in 2008?
  
  2. Based on number of cylinders, calculate the average highway and city mpg, in both 1999 and 2008, as well as the difference bewteen highway and city mpg.
  
`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, font_size = "48px", bottom=0.5)`

#### Review - Tidyverse:
* Collection of R packages for data science, supported by RStudio.

* Core Tidyverse packages are loaded via ```library(tidyverse)```

* Provides a consistent language (functions) and grammar (arguments) that integrates nicely with a piping workflow.
